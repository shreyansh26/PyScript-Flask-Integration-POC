# PyScript-Flask Integration POC

The POC aims to show how to use PyScript with Flask. The Flask server sends some data to the template, PyScript reads it using Pandas and makes a Matplotlib plot on the data. Additionally, I also show how more plots can be displayed on the webpage easily through the PyScript support for Numpy and Matplotlib.
